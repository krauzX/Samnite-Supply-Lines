<h2>The empire is not built by legions, but by cart.</h2><p><b>Samnite Supply Lines</b> is a compact strategy puzzle about the quiet machinery of power. Set during the Third Samnite War in the Roman Republic, you are not a general commanding legions—you are the unseen hand that keeps Rome fed.</p><p>Your task is simple to describe and tricky to master:</p><ol><li><strong>Find Rome</strong> hidden somewhere beyond the fog.</li><li><strong>Build farms</strong> to harvest wheat.</li><li><strong>Deliver grain</strong> before it spoils.</li></ol><p>Each turn, wheat moves automatically toward Rome along the routes you’ve uncovered.<br>Each harvest has a limited lifespan.<br>Each decision shapes the fate of your supply network.</p><p>Random disruptions—raiding parties, tribute demands, shifting opportunities—force you to adapt and rethink your routes. The challenge is not war, but logistics under pressure.</p><p>This game is the first step in the <b>Latent Hegemony™</b> series, a long‑term exploration of systems, influence, and the structures that shape civilizations. Future entries will expand into city‑building, provincial management, and eventually full grand strategy.</p><p>For now, the goal is simple:<br><strong>Feed Rome.</strong><br><a href="#!/game/">Play the prototype now</a>!</p><p>This game is currently in pre-alpha prototyping.

<h2>Devlog #8: Narrowing the Focus, Strengthening the Game</h2><p>When I first set out to build <s>Empires-4x</s> <s>Roman Logistics Tycoon</s> <u>Samnite Supply Lines</u>, the vision was ambitious: a full 4X experience set in Roman Britain, blending exploration, expansion, exploitation, and exterminate mechanics. Over time, though, I’ve realized that ambition can sometimes slow progress — and the heart of the game has always been about logistics, growth, and prosperity.</p><p>So I’m making a deliberate shift. The current project will focus on the Expand and Exploit pillars, evolving into a tycoon-style game set during the Pax Romana. Combat and conquest are stepping aside to make room for a more peaceful, economic challenge: building farms, vineyards, workshops, and trade routes that sustain bustling Roman towns.</p><p>This tighter scope means:</p><ul><li>🎯 Faster progress toward a polished release — less sprawling mechanics, more refined gameplay.</li><li>🌍 A richer setting — southern Gaul or Italy, where peace allows prosperity to flourish.</li><li>🏛️ A clear identity — a logistics and resource management tycoon, not a hybrid 4X.</li></ul><p>And don’t worry — the frontier 4X concept isn’t gone. It’s simply being reserved for a future sequel, where the untamed edges of the empire can shine with exploration and conflict.</p><p>For now, the focus is on delivering a complete, enjoyable tycoon experience sooner rather than later. I’m excited to share this journey with you, and I think this pivot will make the final game stronger, more cohesive, and more fun to play.</p><footer><a href="#!/blog/7/" rel="prev">Previous</a> | <a href="#!/blog/">Blog Home</a> <a href="#!/blog/9/" rel="next">Next</a> |</footer>

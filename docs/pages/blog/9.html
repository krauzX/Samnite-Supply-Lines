<h2>Devlog #9: Narrowing the Scope, Strengthening the Foundation</h2><h3>A Smaller Game With a Clearer Purpose</h3><p>When this project first began, it carried the working title <del>Empires-4x</del> <b>Roman Logistics Tycoon</b> and aimed to simulate the economic machinery of the Roman world: farms, workshops, trade routes, labor specialization, and the slow, satisfying growth of a settlement. That vision hasn’t disappeared—but it has been intentionally postponed.</p><p>Over the past few weeks, I’ve taken a hard look at what I can realistically build, polish, and release in the near term. The result is a deliberate narrowing of scope: a shift from a full logistics tycoon to a focused, turn‑based logistics puzzle.</p><p>This new direction is not a retreat. It’s a foundation.</p><hr style="margin: 2rem 0;"><h3>Introducing the MVP: <i>Samnite Supply Lines</i></h3><p>The first public release in this project’s lifespan will be a compact strategy puzzle set during the Third Samnite War. Instead of managing a sprawling economy, the player takes on the role of a Roman quartermaster tasked with a simple but urgent mission:</p><ul><li>Explore the fog‑shrouded countryside</li><li>Locate the hidden road to Rome</li><li>Build farms to harvest wheat</li><li>Deliver grain before it spoils</li></ul><p>Wheat moves automatically toward Rome at the end of each turn, and each harvest has a limited lifespan. Occasional disruptions—raiding parties, tribute demands, shifting opportunities—force the player to adapt and rethink their routes. The challenge is not warfare, but logistics under pressure.</p><p>This MVP is intentionally small. It is designed to be built quickly, tested thoroughly, and released without the weight of a multi‑year development cycle.</p><hr style="margin: 2rem 0;"><h3>Why Narrow the Scope?</h3><p>There are three main reasons for this shift:</p><h4>1. <strong>Finishing something matters.</strong></h4><p>A small, polished game teaches more—and builds more momentum—than a large, unfinished one. This MVP gives me a realistic path to shipping a complete experience in the near future.</p><h4>2. <strong>The codebase becomes a stepping stone.</strong></h4><p>Even though the MVP is small, its systems—hex maps, fog of war, turn structure, resource movement—are all foundational pieces that future games will build upon. Each release will fork from the previous one, evolving the engine over time.</p><h4>3. <strong>It creates room for a long‑term series.</strong></h4><p>By starting small, I can grow the project gradually into a sequence of increasingly ambitious strategy games. Each entry can explore a different facet of logistics, settlement growth, or grand strategy without being forced to do everything at once.</p><hr style="margin: 2rem 0;"><h3>Looking Ahead (Without Overpromising)</h3><p>While <i>Samnite Supply Lines</i> is a compact puzzle game, it is also the first step in a much larger creative arc. I’m interested in exploring:</p><ul><li>More complex logistics systems</li><li>Settlement growth and city‑building mechanics</li><li>Provincial management across multiple towns</li><li>Historical strategy set in Roman Britain</li><li>Eventually, a modern‑era grand strategy game exploring competing economic and ideological systems</li></ul><p>These ideas are long‑term aspirations, not promises. The goal is to build toward them gradually, one focused release at a time.</p><p><b>Samnite Supply Lines</b> is the first small step in a long‑term strategy series I’m calling <strong>Latent Hegemony</strong>. This MVP is intentionally limited in scope, serving as a foundation for everything that may come after.</p><hr style="margin: 2rem 0;"><h3>Thank You for Following Along</h3><p>If you’ve been watching this project evolve, thank you. This shift in direction is meant to make development more sustainable, more focused, and ultimately more rewarding—for both me and anyone who chooses to play the game.</p><p>More updates will follow as the MVP takes shape. For now, the mission is simple:</p><p style="font-size: 1.2rem; font-style: italic; text-align: center; margin-top: 1.5rem;">Feed Rome. One harvest at a time.</p>

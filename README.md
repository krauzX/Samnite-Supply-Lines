# Samnite Supply Lines
## A Latent Hegemony™ Project

I'm building a tycoon game! You can [play now](https://yodasws.github.io/Samnite-Supply-Lines/#!/game/) in your browser.

**Samnite Supply Lines** is a small, turn‑based logistics puzzle set during the Third Samnite War in the Roman Republic.
You begin as a Roman quartermaster stationed in unfamiliar territory, tasked with a simple but urgent mission: **find Rome, build farms, and keep the grain flowing before it spoils.**

Explore branching paths through fog‑shrouded hills, recruit farmers from Rome, and establish a network of wheat‑producing farms. Each harvest must reach Rome within a limited number of turns, and random events—Samnite raids, Roman levies, shifting territory—can disrupt even the best‑laid plans.

This project serves as **Game 0** in the *Latent Hegemony™* series: a foundation for future logistics, city‑building, and grand‑strategy titles. It is intentionally small, focused, and experimental.

### Core Features
- Turn‑based logistics puzzle gameplay
- Fog‑of‑war exploration
- Wheat production with spoilage timers
- Simple supply‑line routing toward Rome
- Occasional random events that reshape the map
- Built as the groundwork for future strategy systems

### Status
Active prototype. Mechanics, UI, and balance are evolving rapidly.
